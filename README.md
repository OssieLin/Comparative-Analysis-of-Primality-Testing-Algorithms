This project is the comparative analysis of different primality testing algorithms.\
\
Modern cryptography algorithms like RSA need primality tests to generate large random primes.\
Specifically, RSA uses the product of two prime numbers to generate the public and private keys; if these primes are predictable, it makes it easier for an attacker to break the encryption scheme.\
\
Large random primes are constructed in practice by generating pseudorandom numbers and then doing a primality test such as the Fermat primality test or something more powerful such as the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test.\
These primality tests fail for certain numbers called **pseudoprimes**.\
My research focuses on analyzing the class of Perrin-type primality tests- **Lucas-Type Sequence**. Dougherty-Bliss and Zeilberger looked at these recently. They find that certain recurrent sequences produce primality tests for which the smallest pseudoprime is very large.
